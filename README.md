# Pokemon
Me messing around and creating a console version of one of my favorite games -- Pokemon!

Right now it is in very early stages. Thus far I have created a pokemon file which essentially plays a very simple version of Pokemon in the console showing a health bar as well as giving the options to Run, Fight, and even try to catch a pokemon. Right now I am attempting to fix the bugs while catching the pokemons, as there seems to be a problem figuring out how to add the pokemon to each players pokedex... I have started debugging this issue through making 3 new files (Pokedex, DCLL, and pokemon_player)
